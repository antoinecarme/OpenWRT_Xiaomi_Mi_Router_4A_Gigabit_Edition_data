Every operation in lftp is reliable, that is any non-fatal error is handled and the operation is retried automatically. So if downloading breaks, it will be restarted from the point automatically. Even if ftp server does not support REST command, lftp will try to retrieve the file from the very beginning until the file is transferred completely. This is useful for dynamic-ip machines which change their IP addresses quite often, and for sites with very bad internet connectivity.  lftp has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several commands in parallel in background (&). It is also possible to group commands within () and execute them in background. All background jobs are executed in the same single process. You can bring a foreground job to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command `wait' (or `fg' which is alias to `wait'). To list running jobs, use command `jobs'. Some commands allow redirecting their output (cat, ls, ...) to file or via pipe to external command. Commands can be executed conditionally based on termination status of previous command (&&, ||).  lftp has builtin mirror which can download or update a whole directory tree. There is also reverse mirror (mirror -R) which uploads or updates a directory tree on server.

It allows all mesh parameters supported by the wireless driver to be set in the uci config file. Settings take effect immediately without having to restart the wireless network. Default settings give rapid and reliable layer 2 mesh convergence. Without mesh11sd, many mesh parameters cannot be set in the uci wireless config file as the mesh interface must be up before the parameters can be set. Some of those that are supported, would fail to be implemented when the network is (re)started resulting in errors or dropped nodes. The mesh11sd daemon dynamically checks configured parameters and sets them as required. This version does not require a Captive Portal to be running.

redsocks - 0.5-2 - Redsocks is a daemon running on the local system, that will transparently tunnel any TCP connection via a remote SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy server. It uses the system firewall's redirection facility to intercept TCP connections, thus the redirection is system-wide, with fine-grained control, and does not depend on LD_PRELOAD libraries.  Redsocks supports tunneling TCP connections and UDP packets. It has authentication support for both, SOCKS and HTTP proxies.  Also included is a small DNS server returning answers with the "truncated" flag set for any UDP query, forcing the resolver to use TCP.
refpolicy - 2.20200229-3 - The SELinux Reference Policy project (refpolicy) is a complete SELinux policy that can be used as the system policy for a variety of systems and used as the basis for creating other policies. Reference Policy was originally based on the NSA example policy, but aims to accomplish many additional goals.  The current refpolicy does not fully support OpenWRT and needs modifications to work with the default system file layout. These changes should be added as patches to the refpolicy that modify a single SELinux policy.  The refpolicy works for the most part in permissive mode. Only the basic set of utilities are enabled in the example policy config and some of the pathing in the policies is not correct.  Individual policies would need to be tweaked to get everything functioning properly.
